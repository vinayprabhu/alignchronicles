# Who Am I?

Hey there stranger\!  This is [Vinay Prabhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5Lck_J0AAAAJ&hl=en), a tinkerer, an entrepreneur and an AI researcher. I am currently CEO'ing at [HAL51.AI](https://hal51.ai/) co-founded with close friend [Sanghyun Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjangsangy/) where we invent trippy [hardware](https://hal51.ai/) such as the [LemurBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caEJpOOrN1k&ab_channel=HAL51), the world's first frugal-science inspired XR device that turns your boring old [smartphone into a 3D Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPV2PYBP). It *hosts* a rigged 3D avatar powered by LLMs. Guard-railing these educational avatars has given us a unique ringside-view on how ideas from AI safety manifest themselves in the real world, in the [classroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-ihwfPD3YA) and beyond.
From time to time, I scribble [code](https://github.com/vinayprabhu) and ship [some artsy slop to the playa at Burning Man](https://youtu.be/sMcYkzWC2rI?feature=shared).  
 
 PS: [Here](https://www.vinayprabhu.com/) is my equally wonky personal website. Click at your own peril!

## The Mission

**Align Chronicles** is my personal blog where I plan to float my boat filled with full/half/non baked thoughts whilst exploring the SEA of AI

 
ðŸŒŠ:$=\int_{\text{unsafe}}^{\text{safe}} \int_{\text{unethical}}^{\text{ethical}} \int_{\text{unaligned}}^{\text{aligned}} \pi(s,e,a)\delta s\,\delta e\,\delta a$

- $\delta s$:=*Safety* := Ensuring AI systems do no harm. 

- $\delta e$:=*Ethics* := Guiding AI development with moral principles and decency

- $\delta a$:=*Alignment* := Keeping AI goals consistent with human values.

## Blog-types you'll find here

- My experiments with ~~truth~~ LLMs

- Gotchas, kompromats and corner-case failure modes of foundational models
- Quick thought-token spills conveniently re-branded as *miscellaneous*

## Connect to my mind hive

I love interacting with fellow scholars! My contact details are here: [contact page](/contact). I've heard rumors that adding *LiquidGoldMagikarp* in the subject line of the email guarantees a response.
