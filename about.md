## The Mission

**Align Chronicles** is my personal blog where I plan to float my boat filled with full/half/non baked thoughts whilst exploring the SEA of AI

 
ðŸŒŠ:$=\int_{\text{unsafe}}^{\text{safe}} \int_{\text{unethical}}^{\text{ethical}} \int_{\text{unaligned}}^{\text{aligned}} \pi(s,e,a)\delta s\,\delta e\,\delta a$

- $\delta s$:=*Safety* := Ensuring AI systems do no harm. 

- $\delta e$:=*Ethics* := Guiding AI development with moral principles and decency

- $\delta a$:=*Alignment* := Keeping AI goals consistent with human values.

## Blog-types you'll find here

- My experiments with ~~truth~~ LLMs

- Gotchas, kompromats and corner-case failure modes of foundational models
- Quick thought-token spills conveniently re-branded as *miscellaneous*
